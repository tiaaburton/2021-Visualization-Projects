# 2021 Visualization Projects

### Project 1: Movie Streaming + Plotly
In this project, I focus on the visual library and how the library can be used to communicate more about the data in scope. With the Movies Streaming Data, the analysis utilizes the Plotly Express library to utlimately showcase the ratings for each genre for each age group by the service its hosted on. Please find the remaining links within the ipynb file.

### Project 2: Netflix EDA
At the completion of my Info Vis I course, I wanted to showcase the skills that I had learned. I briefly showcase the most pertinant information to continue the analysis using Altair. This file is still a work in progress, but it is near completion. After drafting session, I upload the latest version. The final copy will be uploaded with the data from Kaggle and more information about the plotting libraries use with justification of technique.
